## Description
This program creates a new PowerPoint slide containing the user specified Title, 
Body Text, and optionally, one or more pictures.

The "Suggest Images" button suggests images found in the user's Pictures folder 
based on the words found in the title and bold words present in the body text.

Any images which are 'checked' are added to the PowerPoint slide when the user 
clicks the "Create Slide" button.
